# MongoMail
A highly customizable NoSQL mail plugin for BungeeCord networks. Scaleable to a network of thousands, yet perfect for a network of dozens, MongoMail is the perfect solution for networks looking for cross-server mail. Built around MongoDB, a cross-platform NoSQL database solution, MongoMail presents the flexibility of NoSQL, while keeping the user experience clean and simple.


# Commands
MongoMail comes with several commands to provide a flexible system for both players and administrators. Required parameters are enclosed  with (), while optional ones are enclosed with <>.
```
#Player commands
/mail send (player) (message) | Sends a mail message to a player
/mail read <pg #> | Read your mail, optionally more pages
/mail delete (ID #) | Deletes a specific message, based on the last page of read mail
/mail clear | Deletes all mail

#Administrator commands
/mail snoop (player) <pg #> | Snoop on another player's mail; will show as if they are looking at it.
/mail admindel (player) (ID #) | Forcibly delete a message sent to another player's inbox.
```

# Permissions
MongoMail only has one permission node, "mongomail.admin", which is required for all administrator commands. Otherwise, all commands will work immediately. 

# Configuration
MongoMail's simple config.yml file keeps you from spending hours configuring every tiny aspect, while maintaining high level customizations. Here is a copy of the default configuration file, with added comments for further clarification.
```
settings:
    enabled: true //Globally enable or disable the plugin; requires restart
    reminder: true //Globally enable or disable the mail reminder
    colorCodes: false //Whether to allow for color codes to be sent in the mail message or not
    sendLimit: 0 // Limit the number of mail messages a player may have actively sent (recalculated on deletion/clears). 0 to disable
    receiveLimit: 0 //Limit the inbox size. 0 to disable
    reminderDelay: 30 //Number of minutes between each mail reminder run. Only enabled if reminder is set to true
mongo:
    database: MongoMail //The database to use. Note that sub tables are created (players, mail)
    host: '127.0.0.1' //Where to find the database. Use "127.0.0.1" for local
    port: 27017 //Which port is accepting MongoDB connections. 27017 is default
```

# Messages
MongoMail allows you to customize almost any message, and use legacy color codes in the messages ('&'). While we highly recommend extreme caution when editing the `messages.yml`, you are free to customize it fully. Keep in mind that anything between the curly braces `{...}` is required content for that message, and may cause major issues if it is removed. A new file can be generated by deleting the old one and restarting the BungeeCord.
